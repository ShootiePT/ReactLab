## Introduction

As I embark on the journey of learning and practicing React, I recognize the importance of understanding its foundations within web development. Exploring the evolution of this field not only acquaints me with its history but also instills a deeper understanding and appreciation for the new technology I'm about to delve into. By delving into the roots of web development and its technologies, I aim to grasp the essence and purpose behind React's design.

This week, my focus is on immersing myself in web development principles, exploring various web technologies, and taking the initial steps into the world of React. I believe that this holistic approach will not only equip me with the necessary skills but also provide me with a solid foundation to build upon as I progress through the lab.
