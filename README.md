# React Lab

## My Study Workflow

-   Each week, new resources and exercise templates are provided.
-   Within each week's directory, I created a folder where I'll commit my solutions.

## Lab Structure

-   I dedicate **3 hours** every day to self-study and hands-on practice using the provided materials.
-   The Discord channel serves as a **community** hub where I can get help with frustrations, bugs, ideas, features, and more.
-   We have a **2-hour** synchronous session every **Monday** and **Friday**. During these sessions, mentors are available to set goals, answer questions, and engage in discussions.

## Personal Note

I embarked on this React Lab journey to significantly boost my understanding of React and sharpen my front-end development skills. This structured lab will not only help me master React but also prepare me for future front-end challenges and opportunities. I'm looking forward to growing and learning within this supportive environment.

## JavaScript and React

-   This lab offers a comprehensive zero to hero experience in _JavaScript_ and _React_!
-   _TypeScript_ is not included in the materials, but since it is a superset of JavaScript, transitioning to it after this lab should be straightforward.
-   We start with **ES5** to build a strong foundation before moving on to **ES6** and modern JavaScript syntax. Understanding older versions is crucial as I might encounter them in future projects.
-   Although _HTML_ and _CSS_ are not the main focus, they are integral to web development. I'll be learning these technologies alongside React to ensure a well-rounded skill set.
